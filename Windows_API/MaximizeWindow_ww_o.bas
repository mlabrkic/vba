' 1: Please give me an example of a Windows Excel vba macro. I want to maximize another window.
' 2: I want to maximize that window even when it is already maximized.

' --------------------
' Here's an example of a VBA macro that maximizes another window in Excel:
'
' Replace `"Title of the Window"` with the exact title of the window you want to maximize.
' This macro uses Windows API functions to find and maximize the specified window.

' This code will minimize the window first and then maximize it,
' ensuring it is maximized regardless of its initial state.

' Declare the necessary Windows API functions
Private Declare Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" (ByVal lpClassName As String, ByVal lpWindowName As String) As Long
Private Declare Function ShowWindow Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal nCmdShow As Long) As Long

' Constants for the ShowWindow function
Private Const SW_MINIMIZE As Long = 6
Private Const SW_MAXIMIZE As Long = 3
